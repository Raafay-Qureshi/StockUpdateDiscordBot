# Stock Update Discord Bot  
A Discord bot experiment built using **JavaScript** and the **Discord.js framework** to allow users to update and track stock information via custom commands.

---

## Overview
This project was an experiment to explore **Discord bot development** and real-time data management. The bot allows users to update and track stock information using custom commands. While it no longer has practical use, it served as a great learning experience for working with **JavaScript, Discord.js, and command-line interactions**.

## What I Learned
- **Discord Bot Development:** Gained hands-on experience building a bot using the **Discord.js framework**.
- **Command Handling:** Implemented custom commands to allow users to update and check stock information.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Learned how to manage and display real-time data within a Discord server.
- **JavaScript Skills:** Improved my proficiency in **JavaScript** and working with asynchronous programming.

---

## How It Works
1. **Command Input:** Users can update stock information using commands
2. **Data Storage:** The bot stores the updated stock information in memory.
3. **Real-Time Display:** The bot displays the updated stock information to the server in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Framework:** Discord.js
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub

## Disclaimer
This project was created as an **experiment** to learn and explore Discord bot development. It is no longer in active use and has no practical application today. It does not interact with any external APIs or systems and relies solely on user input for stock updates.

## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build **real-time, interactive applications** using Discord bots.
- Handle **user input and commands** effectively.
- Create **modular and scalable code** that can be extended with new features.
